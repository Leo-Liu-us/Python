works but didn't pass the Leetcode online judgement
the error is: maxmum memory exceeded
It works to showcase the main idea
Instead of passing the whole preorder and inorder lists,
one alternative is to pass the starting and ending indexes of sub preorder and inorder lists
if one doesn't use sys.setrecursionlimit to change the recursive depth,
this function can be used to test the default call depth:

'''
# preorder and inorder are identical
preorder = range(0,973)
inorder = range(0,973)
s = Solution()
tree = s.buildTree(preorder, inorder)
'''
